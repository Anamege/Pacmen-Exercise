# Pacmen-Exercise

Description: The aim of this project is to demonstrate ability to apply certain JavaScript skills. In this project, I applied functions such as edge detection, checkPageBounds, setIntervals, and setTimeouts to make PacMen bounce from one side of the screen to the other then reversing upon reaching the left and right edges of the screen.
Usage: This JavaScript exercise is quite beneficial and can be useful in programs or apps dealing with animations, motion, edge detection, and timing.
Credit / Support: This exercise was completed using several resources such as MIT Xpro bootcamp, W3 Schools, and MDN.
